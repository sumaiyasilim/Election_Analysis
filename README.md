# Election Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this election audit analysis was to retrieve additional information as per the election commissionsâ€™ request. This includes what the voter turnout was for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and which county had the highest voter turnout.

## Election-Audit Summary
This script, with some modifications, can be used for any election.

One way that it can be used is by loading a different file into this section of the code:
 - file_to_load = os.path.join("election_results.csv")

By substituting "election_analysis.csv" with any other csv file that has other county election results, the script will be able to be used for those elections. Replacing this csv file would mean that we could have more candidates and multiple counties that the code would be able to take into account and create an output for.

Another modification that can be made is that when the csv file is changed, this script can be used for other types of elections, other than county. The parts of the code that would need to be changed would be like:

Wherever it says "county" would need to be changed to fit the type of election it would be for.
