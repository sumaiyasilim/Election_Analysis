## Election-Audit Summary
This script, with some modifications, can be used for any election.
One way that can be used is by loading a different file into this section of the code:
 - file_to_load = os.path.join("election_results.csv")

By replacing "election_analysis.csv" with any other csv file that has other election results, the script will be able to be used for any election.
Replacing this csv file would mean that we could have more candidates and multiple counties that the code would be able to account for and create an output for.
